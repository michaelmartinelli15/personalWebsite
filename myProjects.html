          <h3>Space Age</h3>
          <p>
            Space Age is a cooperative space combat game that requires two players to balance the three tasks of piloting, gunning, and repairing the ship's subsystems, all while trying to defeat enemy fighters, avoid procedurally-generated asteroids, and survive for as long as possible. When the player ship takes damage, it is inflicted upon the overshield/main health, while also damaging one of the three ship subsystems: Shield, Weapons, and Navigation. As these subsystems are depleted, so does the performance of the ship's actual systems, with Shield affecting overshield regeneration, Weapons affecting player damage, and Navigation affecting speed and velocity. In order to restore these systems, players must abandon their current task of either piloting or gunning and run over to one of the subsystems to repair them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Space Age was developed in Unity using C# and was created for the 2019 UNR ACM Hackathon in a 24 hour period by myself and three other teammates. I worked primarily on User Interface design, game balancing, critical hit registration, subsystem management, and damage tracking.

          <h3>Brofessor Beef's Gainz Tracker</h3>

          <p>
            Broffessor Beef's Gainz Tracker is a prototype weight lifting companion app that allows users to keep track of their workouts and their progress as they work to achieve their fitness goals. Users can create exercises which consist of a name, the number of sets, the number of reps, and a starting weight. These exercises can then be added to a workout, which consists of a workout name and a collection of exercises. From here, they can perform workouts, which will display to the screen and allow users to change their weight, navigate to the next exercise, and mark the workout as completed when appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            This app served as my final project for CS 420, Human-Computer Interaction, so, naturally, I took a user-first design approach, emphasizing the User Interface design and interaction, rather than the functionality. As such, there are some additional planned features that were not included in the final version of the project because they went beyond the scope of the class such as some social networking elements or the ability to view progress on a line graph or a calendar. The core of the app, however, is fully implemented. Brofessor Beef's Gainz Tracker was developed in Xcode using the Swift language.
